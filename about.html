        <h2>About me</h2>
        <h3>My Professional Career</h3><a name="about_car"></a>
        <p>
          My name is Matthew Shane Kingon, I live in Cape town South Africa, I have a drivers license.  During my Gap year I aquired my PPL (Private Pilots Licence) which I saddly lost at the end.
          due to a previously unknown medical issues with my hearing.  I hope to eventually return to flying once I can succesfully pass my medical again.  Saddly I doubt that this will be any
          time soon as the yearly MRI's put the medical examiner on alert.
        </p>

        <p>
           My education saw me move up to Grahamstown for the past 5 years.  The first three of which I spent getting my degree.  Starting out with plans to major
           in Mathematics and Physics&electronics.  However, after my first year I realised that I rather liked my one arb subject, namely Computer science, so I decided to
           swap Physics for Computrer Science and finnished my degree as such.  I then stayed on to do Honors in computer science with 2 modules (Interfacing I, II)
           from the Physics dept. finnishing that by the end of 2015.
         </p>

         <p>
           I then stayed on one more year (2016) so as to be around for my sister who was finnishing her own undergrad and my girlfriend finnishing her masters.  Getting
           a simple job in IT (Insight Technologies).  Luckily for me, one of their clients (DSAE) found good use in my education and so I was able to build up a sizeable time comitment
           with them doing multiple script projects.  They are a dictionary Unit so most of the work was rather simple file IO and fixing up various XML databases.  They have permitted me to keep a few of
           them along with some working data.  You can find these on my Github profile listed as such.  The work was mostly Python based along with xslt.
          </p>

          <h3>My Hobbies</h3><a name="about_Hob"></a>
          <p>
            I Have a few Hobbies I rather enjoy.  Chief among them would be PC gaming. Other than that, I enjoy building and painting
            Models along with watching series and movies (to a much lesser extent).  I have also picked up reading again.
          </p>
          <p>
            I Have been playing PC' games since early Highschool, and it has always taken up the majority of my free time.  My
            Preferences have shifted over time but I can say quite confidently that 'RTS' holds my attention the longest, Moba to a lesser
            extent.  Other than that, story rich games from any genre are fair game.  I never really got into competitive FPS/strategy games.
            As I have always far prefered to play such games with as many freinds as possible never really liking the solo que's.  This made it quite difficult to
            stick with enough momentum with a single group to actually climb the competitive ladders.
          </p>
          <p>
            As far as Model building/painting goes I have been interested in them for just as long as I have been Gaming, just not to the
            same extent.  I usually build and paint warhammer items as I simply find them more enjoyable and rewarding than boats/tanks
            and planes.  I'd also like to think i'm fairly decent at it as well.
          </p>
          <p>
            My Musical preference is 'Miricle of Sound' I almost listen to his songs exclusivly.
          </p>

          <h3>My Proffesional Interests (aka pet projects)</h3><a name="about_int"></a>
          <p>
            A Rather Underwelming Section, I do have a few in the works, I'd like to move forward with a project that aims to determine if
            two words are the same, or simmilar, plurals etc. (ultimatly working even across two or more languages and all the mixed versions of the same
            words that such cross language mixups entail).
          </p>
          <p>
            Another Project i'd like to work on and have had somewhat more success is an encryption method utilising the pass-phrase iteslf to mix up
            (and decrypt) the chat message. I.e. assign differenet mixing operations to each letter in the alphabet and have that determine how the
            sentance gets mixed up.  Obviously, the longer the pass-phrase the longer it will take to encrypt/decrypt.  However, on the same token,
            the stronger the encryption will become.
          </p>
          <p>
            I guess getting fit also qualifies for this section.
